C++ Embedded Ruby w/ bindings
-----------------------------
The end goal was to make an embeddable ruby application. There are
two examples in the directories "module_example" and "class_example".
They show how to embed ruby with a module and a class. 

To compile, ensure you have ruby-devel installed and run:
g++ _FILENAME_.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs ruby` -o __OUTPUT_FILE__

You may need to replace 'ruby' with ruby-1.9 depending on your platform.
