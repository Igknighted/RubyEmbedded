C++ Embedded Ruby w/ bindings
-----------------------------
The end goal was to make an embeddable ruby application. There are
two examples in the directories "module_example" and "class_example".
They show how to embed ruby with a module and a class. 

To compile, ensure you have ruby-devel installed and run:
g++ _FILENAME_.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs ruby` -o __OUTPUT_FILE__

You may need to replace 'ruby' with ruby-1.9 depending on your platform.



Windows can be a bit more confusing. Just install the mingw
implementation with msys, g++, and whatnot. Also have to install ruby, I
installed 2.0.0 from here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/

Found it through: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/#rubyinstaller


To compile:

$ g++ -I/c/Ruby200-x64/include/ruby-2.0.0/ \
-I/c/Ruby200-x64/include/ruby-2.0.0/x64-mingw32/ \
/c/Ruby200-x64/lib/libx64-msvcrt-ruby200.dll.a \
_FILENAME_.cpp \
-o __OUTPUT_FILE__
